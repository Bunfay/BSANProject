## Cleaning Data

```{r}
#Covid data file, Columns broken into (Date, Country, Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths) 
covid.df <- read.csv(file="countries-aggregated_csv.csv")

#Fixing the datasheet regarding unemployment values, only selecting (Country, Date, Percentage of Unemployed)
unemployment_all.df <- read.csv(file="Unemployment Rates_All Persons_2019M1-2020M12.csv")
unemployment.df <- unemployment_all.df[,c(2,9,17)]

#Setting Covid date and Unemployment date as a date-type field
library(readr)
covid.df$Date <- as.Date(covid.df$Date)
covid_Monthlytotal.df <- covid.df[covid.df$Date == "2020-01-31" | covid.df$Date == "2020-02-29" | covid.df$Date == "2020-03-31" | covid.df$Date == "2020-04-30" | covid.df$Date == "2020-05-31" | covid.df$Date == "2020-06-30" | covid.df$Date == "2020-07-31" | covid.df$Date == "2020-08-31" | covid.df$Date == "2020-09-30" | covid.df$Date == "2020-10-31" | covid.df$Date == "2020-11-30" | covid.df$Date == "2020-12-31",]

#We need to introduce a day of 01 to match R's date time format of YYYY-MM-DD
unemployment.df$TIME <- as.Date(paste(unemployment.df$TIME,"-01",sep=""))
unemployment.df <- unemployment.df[unemployment.df$TIME >= "2020-01-01" & unemployment.df$TIME <= "2020-12-31",]

```

## Visualization

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
#Checking data for:
#United States, Russia, France, United Kingdom, Australia, Spain, Italy
unemployment_cleaned <- unemployment.df %>%
  select(date, Austrlia, Confirmed) %>%
  gather(key = "Country", value = "Value", -date)
head(df)

a <- ggplot(data = covid.df, aes(x = covid.df$Date, y = covid.df$Confirmed)) + geom_line() + xlab("")
a
